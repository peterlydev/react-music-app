## Exercises (To-dos)

Music App: Create a React Website that showcases your favourite artists songs/albums.

Using JSX make your website a portfolio of their work. The site should be broken down into components that are rendered on the same page. It should contain at the very minimum two components. An example would be:

### Completed

* Their name, music type and an introduction paragraph.
* A list of their songs/albums including name,release date and cover art.
* Build & deploy your React app
* Have a go at styling your app
* Add an element eg. a button, or an icon next to each song
* Pass data from a parent component to a child component (Props)
* Pass a callback function from a parent component to a child component and invoke it on an event in the child component
* fetch some data from an API of your choice (lyrics.ovh or Bandsintown are two options with no required authentication or key but feel free to use any!)

### To-do

* When a user clicks the Like button element, change something about it to indicate the user has 'liked' the song

* When a user clicks again, the element should revert back to the 'unliked' view

* Use state to track if a track has been liked or not

* set an interval for something to happen (it doesn't have to involve an API call - how about a background colour that changes every 30 seconds?) and make sure to clear it in a timely manner!
